# Where this build is up to

Read this first when picking the work back up. Branch:
`claude/app-build-k2ag1d`.

## Done

All of SPEC.md's built phases and every amendment feature are implemented:

- Core: Today, food logging with the allergen engine, barcode, adaptive TDEE,
  Progress, training with progression rules, settings.
- Hydration, explosive performance metrics, NFC meal tags, weekly PDF report.
- OpenRouter layer: photo estimate, Recipe Hunter, Plan B, menu import, daily
  insight, model picker and in-app benchmark.
- Health Connect with BMR-netted workout calories.
- JSON/CSV export, encrypted nightly backups over WebDAV, SFTP and SMB.
- Sync server (`server/intake_sync.py`), sync client, device pairing UI.
- Wear OS companion (`wear/`, `wearprotocol/`).
- Adaptive landscape and tablet layout.
- Privacy screen and `docs/PRIVACY.md`.
- Intake script (`docs/scripting/`, `domain/script/`): hand-written meal plans and
  programs. Plan tab: Import plan (`.md`/`.txt`/`.json`, detected by content) and
  Export plan as script. Train tab: Import program; program builder: Export program
  as script. Errors open a diagnostics sheet with "How to fix"; warnings and allergen
  hits show in the preview. Program import is one Room transaction with ids from
  `seedId` (program name + day index + exercise name), so re-import updates in place
  and missing rows are soft-deleted. `ExerciseDoc.weight` is
  `program_exercise.startWeightKg` (in schema v2 and `MIGRATION_1_2`), used as the
  first prescription when a lift has no history. The wiki is bundled into assets by
  the `copyScriptDocs` task in `app/build.gradle.kts` and shown by
  `ScriptReferenceScreen` (`domain/docs/Markdown.kt` parses it).

Docs: `docs/SPEC.md`, `docs/SPEC-amendments.md`, `docs/BACKUP.md`,
`docs/BENCHMARK.md`, `docs/PRIVACY.md`, `server/README.md`.

## Verified

- JVM unit tests pass.
- Backup transports (WebDAV, SFTP with host-key pinning, SMB) tested against
  real servers with `INTAKE_REMOTE_IT=1`.
- Two-device sync through the real server, with `INTAKE_SYNC_IT=1`.
- Both release APKs (`app-release.apk`, `wear-release.apk`) were built and
  signed with the same certificate.

## Not built

- The user's actual 12-week plan content. The meal plan module (SPEC section 9: week
  strip, shopping list, steps, cook mode, "can't eat what I cooked", plan-file
  import) is built and data-driven, but ships empty. Fill it by assigning saved
  recipes or importing a plan file (`docs/MEAL-PLAN.md`). `FoodSeed` is still not
  paired with a recipe seeder.
- Demo data loader in Settings (`SettingsRepository.demoDataLoaded` exists).

## NOT verified

- No emulator or on-screen visual check of any screen (this includes the script import sheets and the reference screen).
- No real OpenRouter calls. The client, prompts and parsing are tested only
  against fakes and fixtures.
- No real watch and phone pairing. The Data Layer path has not run on devices.
- No NFC hardware. Tag writing and reading are untested on a device.
- Health Connect has not run on a device.
- Vision (photo estimate) is not benchmarked. No photos with known answers are
  bundled, so the picker shows it as "not benchmarked".

## Invariants to keep

- Keys are user-supplied and kept in EncryptedSharedPreferences. They are sent
  only in headers and never logged.
- Nothing is hard-deleted. Rows get `deletedAt`, and every read filters
  `deletedAt IS NULL`. Sync relies on this.
- Timestamps are UTC epoch millis. Day boundaries come from `DayRange`/`Clock`.
  Weights are stored in kg and lengths in cm. Pounds and inches are display
  only.
- Never use `fallbackToDestructiveMigration`.
- A model can raise an allergen warning but never clear one. The local engine
  decides.
- Room schema v2 is unreleased. Changes may still go into v2, with
  `schemas/2.json` regenerated and the migration test kept passing.
- `domain/` must not import `android.*`.
- Every way to add food goes through `AllergenRepository.scan` first.
- Macro columns on `food` are per 100 g. `food_log` stores absolute amounts
  copied at log time.
- Instrumented test method names must be camelCase. D8 rejects spaces in dexed
  lambda class names below DEX 040.

## Build environment notes

- AGP 9 has built-in Kotlin support. Do not apply `org.jetbrains.kotlin.android`.
  The root `build.gradle.kts` `buildscript` block raises Kotlin and KSP, so keep
  it in step with `libs.versions.toml`.
- KSP is pinned at 2.3.12 because the 2.3.13 plugin marker is incompletely
  published.
- Charts use Compose Canvas, not Vico.
- `local.properties` holds the SDK path and signing properties. It is untracked.
  Never commit or print it.
- Release signing properties: `RELEASE_STORE_FILE`, `RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD`,
  `RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS`, `RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD`. The wear module reads the same
  ones, so both APKs get the same key.

## Known gaps and judgment calls

- Not stored by program import: day notes and exercise notes (no columns). New
  exercises from a script get primary muscle "other".
- Plan export writes shopping rows the recipes would not generate themselves;
  generated lists and the plan-wide pantry go back as they came. Check marks are not exported.
- The mockup's "optional web assistant" is not built. It would add a network
  path beyond those in SPEC section 3.2. Amend the spec or drop it from the
  design before anyone writes it.
- Whole-word allergen matching does not catch derived words such as "creamery".
  A test pins this.
- `TrainingRepository.consecutiveFailures` looks only at the last session.
- The sync server stores rows as plaintext SQLite, by design.
- The MCP server from the amendments roadmap is not built.
